# WorkoutApp
Hellooo! This is one of my inital phase of android development using kotlin.

I dont know about economy , prices , stocks and all but one thing that is surely going up is WEIGHT!haha.  
So , here in have made a Workout App using Kotlin.

This app include functionality as follow:-
  1. 7 min workout
  2. BMI calculator
  3. History 
  
  A single cycle of a workout includes 
    1. Rest timer which displays next exercise name & time for rest.
    2. Exercise screen which displays exercise to be done, time left and a view bar which shows on which exercise number the user is.
  
The app is user friendly as well, it includes BMI functionality as well which can be calculated using Metric unit AND US units too!
** fun fact : BMI  does NOT show your fitness level. Bodybuilder usually are BMI 25 and above which comes under overweight **
Along with that i have also include the functionality to store user BMI data permanently on the app using SQLite.

Hope you like it :)
